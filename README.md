# PayEasy - Web3 Payments with Web2 Experience

![PayEasy Logo](https://i.ibb.co/TvDdSdY/payeasy-logo.png)

## üöÄ Problem Statement 
Traditional Web3 payment applications suffer from poor user experience, requiring complicated wallet setups, seed phrase management, and confusing transaction flows. Meanwhile, international remittance services charge high fees and offer unfavorable exchange rates to millions of students and workers abroad.

Born from our personal struggles as international students in Canada sending money home, PayEasy solves these challenges by creating a Web2-like payment experience powered by Stellar and Polkadot blockchain technologies that delivers near-market exchange rates with minimal fees.

## üìä User Base
- **International Students & Workers**: Our primary users who regularly send money home and face excessive fees
- Everyday users who want to transact with digital currency without technical knowledge
- Businesses seeking to integrate crypto payments without disrupting customer experience
- Cross-border payment users looking for faster, cheaper alternatives to traditional banks
- Financial institutions exploring blockchain integration with familiar user interfaces

## üí° Impact
PayEasy democratizes access to blockchain payments by eliminating technical barriers, enabling millions of non-technical users to benefit from:
- Lower transaction fees (savings of 2-5% per transaction)
- Near-instant settlement across borders (vs. 2-5 days)
- Enhanced privacy and security through zero-knowledge proofs
- No need for seed phrases or complicated wallet management

## ‚≠ê Why Stellar
We leverage Stellar Passkeys to provide a seamless and intuitive UX by:
- Enabling biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID) instead of passwords
- Removing the need for seed phrases and private key management
- Creating smart contract-powered wallet accounts that work like traditional accounts
- Utilizing Stellar's fast, low-cost settlement for instant transactions
- Integrating with Polkadot for enhanced privacy features via cross-chain functionality

## üìã Implemented Features
- **Passkey Registration**: Create wallets using device biometrics without seed phrases
- **Seamless Authentication**: Login with device passkeys for Web2-like experience 
- **Multi-Chain Payments**: Send payments on both Stellar and Polkadot networks
- **Real-time Exchange Rates**: Display live currency conversions
- **Enhanced Privacy Controls**: Configurable privacy settings for transactions
- **Transaction Dashboard**: Monitor recent activity and balances
- **Transaction Simulator**: Visualize privacy features before sending
- **Built-in Security Features**: Scam protection and suspicious activity detection
