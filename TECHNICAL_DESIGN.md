## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Interface
- React-based web application
- TailwindCSS for responsive design
- Passkey integration for seamless user authentication
- Progressive disclosure of blockchain elements

### 2. Authentication System
- Passkeys for biometric authentication
- No seed phrases or private keys exposed to users
- Domain-bound smart wallet creation
- Cross-device synchronization

### 3. Validation Service
- Address format validation for both Stellar and Polkadot
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Transaction amount validation
- Memo field validation for Stellar

### 4. Payment Processing
- Smart contract handling payment logic
- Cross-chain asset swapping
- Fee optimization
- Transaction monitoring

### 5. Blockchain Integrations
- Stellar SDK for XLM transfers
- Polkadot.js API for DOT transfers
- Launchtube for gas abstraction on Stellar

## Design Decisions

### Storage Strategy
- Smart contract state stored on respective chains
- User preferences in local browser storage
- No personal data stored in centralized databases

### Contract State Management
- Minimal state design pattern
- Event-driven architecture for state updates
- Separate state contracts from business logic for upgradeability

### Event Emission
- Transaction initiation events
- Confirmation events
- Cross-chain bridging events
- Error events with descriptive messages

### Passkeys Implementation
- WebAuthn standard integration
- Platform authenticator preference
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported devices
- Recovery path through multi-device registration

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Designed a unified interface to handle differing transaction models between Stellar and Polkadot.

2. **Gas Fee Abstraction**: Implemented launchtube integration to shield users from gas fee complexity.

3. **Transaction Finality Discrepancies**: Created a normalized status reporting system to handle different confirmation times across chains.

4. **Smart Wallet Recovery**: Developed a secure recovery mechanism that doesn't expose private keys.

5. **Responsive Error Handling**: Built a comprehensive error handling system that translates blockchain errors into user-friendly messages.

## Components

### Frontend

The frontend consists of three main files:

1. **index.html**: Provides the structure of the application, including the payment form and status displays.
2. **style.css**: Contains all styling, creating a clean, professional interface with visual feedback mechanisms.
3. **app.js**: Handles all application logic, form validation, and interaction with the Stellar network.

### Stellar SDK Integration

The application uses the Stellar JavaScript SDK to:
- Connect to the Stellar testnet
- Load the sender's account
- Create and sign transactions
- Submit transactions to the network
- Process transaction responses

### User Flow

1. User enters recipient address, amount, and optional memo
2. Application validates inputs client-side
3. User submits the form
4. Application shows a loading animation
5. Stellar SDK creates and submits the transaction
6. Application displays success or error message
7. On success, shows transaction ID with link to Stellar Expert

## Design Choices

### Why Use the JavaScript SDK?

We chose the Stellar JavaScript SDK because:
- It can be used directly in the browser without a backend
- It provides a complete API for interacting with Stellar
- It has excellent documentation and community support
- It's accessible to developers with basic JavaScript knowledge

### Why Use the Testnet?

The Stellar testnet provides:
- Free test XLM via Friendbot
- Identical API to the mainnet
- A safe environment for demonstration
- Real blockchain transactions without financial risk

### Storage and State Management

- No persistent storage is used in the current implementation
- Account state is managed by the Stellar ledger
- Transaction state is maintained temporarily in the browser's memory
- A production version would add local storage for transaction history

### Error Handling

We implemented comprehensive error handling to:
- Validate user inputs before submission
- Catch and interpret Stellar API errors
- Present user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed errors to the console for debugging

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Simplifying Technical Concepts**: We abstracted away blockchain complexity while keeping the core functionality intact
2. **User Feedback**: Implemented clear loading, success, and error states
3. **Input Validation**: Created client-side validation to prevent errors before they happen
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured the app works across modern browsers
