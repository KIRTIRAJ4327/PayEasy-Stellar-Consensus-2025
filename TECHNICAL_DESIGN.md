# PayEasy Technical Design Document

## Overview

PayEasy is a web-based application for sending XLM payments on the Stellar testnet, designed with a focus on intuitive user experience. The application demonstrates how blockchain-based payments can be as user-friendly as traditional web applications.

## Components

### Frontend

The frontend consists of three main files:

1. **index.html**: Provides the structure of the application, including the payment form and status displays.
2. **style.css**: Contains all styling, creating a clean, professional interface with visual feedback mechanisms.
3. **app.js**: Handles all application logic, form validation, and interaction with the Stellar network.

### Stellar SDK Integration

The application uses the Stellar JavaScript SDK to:
- Connect to the Stellar testnet
- Load the sender's account
- Create and sign transactions
- Submit transactions to the network
- Process transaction responses

### User Flow

1. User enters recipient address, amount, and optional memo
2. Application validates inputs client-side
3. User submits the form
4. Application shows a loading animation
5. Stellar SDK creates and submits the transaction
6. Application displays success or error message
7. On success, shows transaction ID with link to Stellar Expert

## Design Choices

### Why Use the JavaScript SDK?

We chose the Stellar JavaScript SDK because:
- It can be used directly in the browser without a backend
- It provides a complete API for interacting with Stellar
- It has excellent documentation and community support
- It's accessible to developers with basic JavaScript knowledge

### Why Use the Testnet?

The Stellar testnet provides:
- Free test XLM via Friendbot
- Identical API to the mainnet
- A safe environment for demonstration
- Real blockchain transactions without financial risk

### Storage and State Management

- No persistent storage is used in the current implementation
- Account state is managed by the Stellar ledger
- Transaction state is maintained temporarily in the browser's memory
- A production version would add local storage for transaction history

### Error Handling

We implemented comprehensive error handling to:
- Validate user inputs before submission
- Catch and interpret Stellar API errors
- Present user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed errors to the console for debugging

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Simplifying Technical Concepts**: We abstracted away blockchain complexity while keeping the core functionality intact
2. **User Feedback**: Implemented clear loading, success, and error states
3. **Input Validation**: Created client-side validation to prevent errors before they happen
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured the app works across modern browsers
