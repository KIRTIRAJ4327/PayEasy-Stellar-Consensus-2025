# Why PayEasy?

## Our Story: Born from Real-World Remittance Challenges

As international students in Canada, our team experienced firsthand the frustration of sending money back home. One of our founders shares:

> "Every month, I send money from Canada (CAD) to India (INR) through popular remittance apps like Remitly. While convenient, I noticed significant gaps between the exchange rates I received and actual market rates. For example, when the Google rate showed 1 CAD = 61.33 INR, the remittance app only offered 1 CAD = 61.04 INR. Combined with transaction fees, these seemingly small differences cost international students and workers hundreds of dollars annually."

This experience revealed a critical problem facing millions of international students, workers, and immigrants worldwide. Traditional remittance services and banks often:

- Charge high transfer fees (3-7% on average)
- Offer below-market exchange rates
- Take days to complete transactions
- Lack transparency about the total cost

We built PayEasy to challenge this status quo by leveraging blockchain technology to provide near-market-rate currency exchanges with minimal fees, while maintaining the simple user experience people expect from traditional financial apps.

## The Problem: Web3 UX Often Sucks

Despite the promise of blockchain technology, most Web3 applications suffer from poor user experience that creates significant barriers to adoption:

1. **Complex Onboarding**: Most crypto apps require users to:
   - Create and securely store seed phrases
   - Understand wallet concepts
   - Learn about gas fees and network confirmations
   - Navigate confusing transaction interfaces

2. **Security Anxiety**: Users constantly worry about:
   - Losing access to their funds if they misplace their seed phrase
   - Sending funds to the wrong address
   - Not understanding transaction fees
   - Being vulnerable to scams and phishing

3. **Technical Jargon**: Everyday users are bombarded with unfamiliar terms:
   - Block confirmations
   - Gas fees
   - Chain IDs
   - Public/private key pairs
   - Smart contracts
